# Rancho los Pitufos
Python Flask, HTML, CSS, JS / Restaurant website
<br/><br/><br/>

Rancho los Pitufos is a real restaurant. This is my first website and I have cloned the backbone from the internet and replaced the important bits

Run the following commands in your terminal to run this flask application:

git clone https://github.com/sinisabubonja/pizzabubonjas.git <br/>
python3.6 -m venv RanchoLosPitu <br/>
cd RanchoLosPitu <br/>
source bin/activate<br/>
pip install -r requirements.txt <br/>
python app.py <br/>

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 in a browser and that's it! Don't forget to type your Gmail user name and password in the appropriate text files.
